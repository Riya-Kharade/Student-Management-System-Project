# Student-Management-System-Project

<b>🎓 Student Management System<br>
This Student Management System is a simple command-line project designed to manage student records. It allows adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details.<br>
I developed this project in two programming languages:<br>
Java (without file handling)<br>
Python (with file handling for permanent data storage)<br>
The system is completely CMD-based (Command Line Interface).<br>
<br><br><br>

<b>📌 Project Overview</b><br>
🔹 Purpose: A basic system for managing student records.<br>
🔹 Languages Used: Java & Python<br>
🔹 Features: Add, update, delete, and view student details.<br>
🔹 Data Storage:<br>
  Java: Uses in-memory storage.<br>
  Python: Uses file handling (students_record.txt) to store data permanently<br><br><br>

<b>🚀 Key Features</b><br>
✅ Add Student – Store new student details.<br>
✅ View Students – Display student records.<br>
✅ Update Student Details – Modify student information.<br>
✅ Delete Student – Remove a student from the system.<br>
✅ File Handling (Python) – Data is stored in a text file permanently..<br><br><br>

<b>🎨 Technologies Used</b><br>
Java – Simple implementation (no file handling).<br>
Python – Uses file handling (students_records.txt) for data persistence<br><br><br>



<b>🎯 Future Enhancements</b><br>
🔹 Add a database (MySQL, SQLite) instead of a text file for Python.<br>
🔹 Improve Java implementation with file handling for data persistence.<br>
🔹 Add a GUI version using Tkinter (Python) or Java Swing.<br><br><br>
